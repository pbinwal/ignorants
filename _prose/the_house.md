    The house stands deserted. It towers against the thick undergrowth that surrounds it— a solitary speck in a sea of green. I can tell that it’s falling apart. <br>
    <br>
    The bricks that make up the wall are crumbling— oozing orange blood that nobody would care to wipe. There’s a mound of rubble that used to be a shed before it came down crashing— weighed down with the guilt of having to witness the house that preceded it fall apart before its eyes.<br>
    <br>
    The stone path that leads to the front door is moss-covered and slippery, and weeds have cropped up in every crack and crevice that they could force their way through.
    <br>
    And before I know it, before I have thought it through— I’ve walked up the front path, swung open the rotting front doors, and made my way in.<br>
    <br>
    The dark that greets me is absolute and unquestioning. It doesn’t give away any answers, nor demands any— but just sits there waiting, watching me, as I move. <br>
    <br>
    My feet seem to remember the floor beneath them only too well. Moments later, they have carried me to the fireplace on my right.<br>
    <br>
    The fire I start is more smoke and less flame, and it pierces through the dark only feebly, unwillingly. But it’s enough for me to see the hearth rug sprawled on the floor, enough to set my thoughts racing to a time when there had been another fire— a luminous dance of orange and gold, another evening— and promises whispered with dying embers—
    <i>‘I love you, now. I love you, this moment’</i>— as if that was enough. As if <i>now</i> was all that mattered, as if a moment full of presence could make up for a lifetime of absence.<br>
    <br>
    The fire is burning brighter now, and I shift my gaze to another corner of the room, now illuminated. An armchair, a wall clock, wind chimes, and...a piano?<br>
    <br>
    I stare at it— the assortment of black and white, but what I really see is the man who sat there once upon a time and made sweet music that filled me like incense in a praying hall.<br>
    <br>
    I bring my hand down and hit a note.<br>
    <br>
    Click. <i>I love you.</i><br>
    Click. <i>I love you.</i><br>
    Click. <i>I loved you?</i><br>
    <br>
    Of course you did. Until the last of the flames had flickered and died. Until the last of the notes had echoed and waned. Until <i>now</i> had wrestled away from my hold and become <i>then</i>. And <i>then</i> you didn’t.<br>
    <br>
    I rise from the stool and make my way to the front door. I do not see the flames leaping ominously now, do not see them rise to the curtains. And even if I did, it would not matter; there’s no turning back.<br>
    <br>
    I walk down the front stone path, past the crumbling wall and the shed that caved in on itself, and out into the night that is engulfed in another kind of darkness.<br>
    <br>
    And behind me, the house that I’ve just left lets out a final groan as it is set ablaze in a fire of my making.
