    My Dear Mother India, <br>
    <br>
    I have seen you in fleeting glimpses. Women draped in electric coloured saris floating down the cramped streets of Ahmedabad and Jaipur. Their children trailing behind, shoving, pushing through the crowd to keep up and not get lost. <br>
    <br>
    In the extravagant palaces and minarets your sons of old built on your soil to flaunt their momentary triumphs. In the lambent flicker of ghee lit diyas held by saffron robed saints and pandits of Banaras. In the distant cries of hawkers and vendors with wrinkled visages pedalling their goods in the moist evenings of Kolkata. In the gangs of ragged street urchins of Bombay deciding on the rules of the cricket match they would play the next afternoon. In the rich aroma of the masala chai Chotu Chaiwala sells and in every toothed smile he gives when a customer generously gives him an extra rupee.<br>
    <br>
    Every Indian household has this place where one can experience an amalgamation of a myriad of your smells and colours. I have. In the typical Indian kitchen. Where sari clad women stir rich curry in iron vessels. Steaming white rice tempered with chutney of fresh mint leaves and ripe tomatoes. In the wide array of ethnic spices decorating the shelves- cumin and tamarind and fenugreek and bay leaves.<br>
    <br>
    As I dig my hands into the aloo parathas and lime pickle, I catch your unmistakable scent in the cuisine.The sweet fragrance of mustard plants— the pods turning brown to harbinger the season of harvest, of men and women gingerly picking the seeds out of the pods and yet managing to make the whole affair seem so simple, so effortless.<br>
    <br>
    I know my mother that there have been days when we have failed you,let you down. There have been times when we, lead astray by our follies and conceits, have fought each other, have harmed and killed. We have worn our pride and ego like sacred badges of victory. We have slain our brothers and sisters— your children, on your pious land.We have bombed your cities, committed all imaginable atrocities and then left innocent, guileless bones break under the weight of our guilt. We have squandered a thousand childhoods, the largest portion of our wealth but what have we bought? Tragedy, upon all of us, mother. And tragedy, upon you.<br>
    <br>
    We are a large family mother, in fact the largest in the world. It is time that we came together to be the strongest.<br>
    <br>
    There is a tear in the social fabric, undoubtedly. A wide yawning hole staring at us in the eyes. But the adhesive we need to fix this has a simple recipe— the ability to empathise and the courage to persist. And in times such as these mother, we need you. We need you more than we ever have.<br>
    <br>
    You know in school they often ask you— what inspires you the most? I think I have the answer now. You do, mother. And to be fair you do more than just inspire.<br>
    <br>
    You show me, mother, the many invigorating and moving shades of Indian life.The sundry layers of your culture keep my mind curious. You remind me to stretch my hands far and wide in all directions so that I can lend a helping hand to my neighbours like you do when they need it the most. You remind me to live a happy and fulfilled life but also to never lose the slow, peaceful meditativeness and contemplation our ancient gurus taught us.<br>
    <br>
    What else can I say to you when I am so impoverished in terms of words to describe you? Let me just ask you for one thing mother— that when I witness my last sunset, let it be in your amaranthine skies, let it be accompanied with the stillness of your holy lands and the placidity of your freshwater springs. And let me fold my hands in communion one last time— to say my namaskar,to revere you for all that you are.<br>
