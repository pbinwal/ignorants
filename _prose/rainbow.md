  The rainbow in the sky has two colours in it. <br>
  And one of them is— <i>not yellow</i>. <br>
  <br>
  You tell me that's the colour of the afternoon sun.<br>

  And that's what butter is supposed to look like when it melts in the heat of you hand. <br>
  Yellow is what you call the mustard fields. <br>

  The lemons, the bananas, the daisies, the canaries. <br>
  You call the lambent flicker of the candle by that name.<br>

  And that's what the second flash of the traffic signal is supposed to look like.<br>
  But the balls with smiling faces— they don't appear as happy to me.
  <br>Though the apricots are just as sweet.<br>
  <br>
  I too stick out my nose in mornings, to breathe in the woody aroma of sandalwood lingering in the pooja hall.<br>
  But what is the colour of yellow, I've often asked and I wish I wouldn't be told, "Why that's the colour of the turmeric paste you coat your face with." <br>
  You cover your body in gold— inches deep and I find it mysterious how you claw your way out each time. <br>
  You say you like the way it all shines, but the 'resplendent hues of autumn' is not a phrase in my dictionary. <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  The rainbow in the sky, has two colours in it. <br>
  And one of them is— <i>not blue</i>.<br>
  <br>
  That's how the sea tides appear when they are still figuring out which side they belong to.<br>

  And I thought I saw them the say way until you told me my eyes were nasty tricksters. <br>
  <br>
  In school days, my notebook used to be the most colourful because I couldn't tell deep red from blue.<br>

  And the teacher thought I'd do well art. <br>
  But daughter— she hates going shopping with me 'cause her Momma doesn't seem to remember her favourite colour.<br>
  But I've decided in my head that next time around here, peacock blue will be my thing.<br>
  <br>
  Stockings— blue. Kitchen— blue. Umbrella— blue. Fingers— blue.<br>
  <br>
  And how does it matter if it's <i>Yellowstone</i> or <i>Bluestone</i> and <i>blue whale</i> or <i>yellow whale</i>?<br>
  Because everyone's gonna stand in awe to watch the <i>Blue Lady</i> walk down the street— spreading <i>blueness</i> like tiny drops from sprinklers in field.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  The rainbow in the sky, has two colours in it.<br>
  And one of them—as you'd have probably figured out by now is— <i>not red</i>.<br>
  <br>
  On Saturday nights I still end up with handfuls of rose petals scattered around me.<br>
  <br>
  He loves me...he loves me not...he loves me...he loves me not...<br>
  <br>
  I do it for hours at a stretch, carefully plucking the petals,hoping perhaps to find some ruby buried in the pistil.<br>
  If I do I would spring upon it like some tiger on the antelope.<br>
  And I would quickly put it on for lenses and watch the world in absolute redness.<br>
  So your red marks can no longer scare me and your red letter days matter no more.<br>
  <br>
  <i>Mars</i> would be here so you can plan missions elsewhere.<br>
  And <i>Greenland</i> would be <i>Redland</i> while no one would see a difference.<br>

  But you tell me there is a difference in the way we see the world.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  The rainbow in the sky, has two colours in it— <br>
  Your violet is my grey and your green is my grey— yes, I can actually see <i>fifty shades</i> of it.<br>
  <br>
  But your sea is my sea and there is nothing wrong in the way I see .<br>
  <br>

  My world isn't any less real though the greyscale mode of your camera does seem silly at times. <br>
  <br>
  Tonight I sit down, knee deep in water,to stare at my eyes in the quiet reflection. <br>
  I swear I see them with that vicious smirk on.<br>
  <br>
  I hunt for canvases and brushes with broken handles.<br>
  And I mix,mix and mix and mix—<br>
  Paint...water...more paint...less water...too thick...water thin— <br>
  I churn the paint like some silent grinder switched on recklessly. <br>
  I maneuver uselessly, hoping, that the sun will shine at some different angle one morning—<br>
  to add one more colour to my rainbow.<br>
