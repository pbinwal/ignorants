  Why does the nightingale,<br>
  Knowing that the world slumbers,<br>
  Still sing sweet melodies,<br>
  Into the silent night ?<br>
  <br>
  He sings to the moon you say,<br>
  But I've seen him sing,<br>
  Alike on moonless nights.<br>
  <br>
  Maybe he sings,<br>
  To wake the sleeping after all.<br>

  On Maslow's pyramid of needs, creativity sits at the top. Having satisfied her physical and emotional needs, a human turns her attention to the act of creating. Eyeing the zenith of the pyramid is when the consumer turns into the creator. Why does the writer ink stacks upon stacks of pages with the mist in her eyes ? Why does the painter wrestle with time to snatch one lone moment from its cold, unforgiving grip? Why does the musician still care to sing, when everyone else has long turned off their radio and gone to bed ? In its purest form, a piece of art is not a means to an end. Its value is inherent, its purpose ensured by the virtue of its existence.<br>
  <br>
  Why make art in a world that doesn't seem to notice? Or worse, a world that <em>does</em> take notice, but shrugs it off as if it were indifferent to it. After all, we are members of a society where the majority is perfectly content to simply consume and not create. Unlike the world a few decades ago, impassioned lovers don't write letters to make affirmations of affection anymore, our pillowcases don't feature elaborate embroideries of flowers or birds, and the cardigans we don aren't handwoven, but mass-manufactured, like almost everything else we own.<br>
  <br>
  For most new-age adults, perhaps the last time they really partook in the process of creating something was when they were still kids in school, and therefore, didn't have the option <em>to not</em> do it. Whether you were forced to write an essay in school or recite a poem in the school assembly, whether you lent your vocals to the school choir, or painted a sunflower field, chances are you did it because you <em>had to</em>. Maybe a part of you even enjoyed it, or maybe you abhorred every moment of it because you knew you weren't really the best at it. And maybe <em>not really</em> being good at it is what kept you from ever doing it again. You discovered that perfection could be elusive, and dejected, you laid down the pen, letting the ink dry. The paint bottles sat in a corner forgotten, and the sunflowers in your painting dessicated and wilted. The choir sang no more, and the music hall sat silent. Sadly that's the fate that befalls most of our artistic selves as we progress through life. The slow drudgery of adult life takes over, leaving little time but to eat, work, sleep and repeat. Even on days when we <em>can</em> afford to spare the time, we <em>choose</em> not to. There are easier, perhaps more relaxing things to do on a weekend than practising Mozart or perfecting your Kathak footwork.<br>
  <br>
  As we grow up, perhaps some of us <em>do</em> attempt to spare time for these things along the way, but those around us are quick to point out that it isn't the most productive thing to be doing. Art won't pay your bills after all (unless of course you take it up as a full time career, and sometimes, even then it won't), but it <em>will</em> require your time. And even if you put in tens or hundreds, even thousands of hours every year there is still no saying that you would certainly end up as the proud creator of a five-act play, paint a Monsa Lisa, or compose the Four Seasons. And even if you are lucky and skilled enough to create your magnum opus, perhaps it just so happens that the world never gets to see it. Perhaps the sunflower field you paint is too vast for the canvas to contain, perhaps there isn't a soul around to listen as you recite the sonnet that you poured yours into, perhaps the melody that you sing falls on deaf ears, perhaps the dance you dance is one of utter solitude.<br>
  <br>
  I say it does not matter.<br>
  <br>
  In times when human attention is a commodity, those who reclaim it to focus it on the act of creating something are a rare breed. Because art both requires and cultivates patience. It requires one to not just look, but <em>observe</em>. Not just hear, but <em>listen</em>. Not just write, but <em>express</em>. It requires you to slow down, turn your attention <em>within</em>, distill the imprint that the outside world left on you, and turn outwards again to share it with the world.<br>
  <br>
  In a world rife with AI generated content, <em>you</em> my dear human hold something special. Housed within the hollow of your skull, is (I hope) a thinking, feeling <em>brain</em>, which, with all its idiosyncrasies, insecurities, longings and misgivings, yearns to express. The universe may be cold and indifferent to whatever you have to say, but through the very act of saying it, you become a rebel who has dared to seek meaning when there may be <em>none</em>.<br>
  <br>
  In a world that burns, one often finds that it is the politician who holds the torch, and the rich who fan the flames. The intellectual tries to figure out who set it on fire, while the activist makes attempts to quell the flames. But it is the artist who gleans the cinders and smears them on her canvas– turning smoke and ash into art, and giving those who care to look, an inkling of what the world <em>could</em> have been.
