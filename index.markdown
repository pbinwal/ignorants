The world we inhabit is a paradox. It's so big that you will never see all of it, yet so small that you can hop on a flight and [travel around it once in a little under 2 days.](https://www.britannica.com/science/How-Long-Does-It-Take-to-Fly-Around-the-World){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer}. It is old- older than human history by several orders of magnitude, yet to the best of our knowledge, the earth itself has been aorund for at most one-third the time [since the universe came into existence.](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/overview/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

We build sprawling cities, the testaments to human progress, yet at the time of writing, [over 3 billion people](https://ourworldindata.org/urbanization){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} live in rural areas. We grow enough food to feed all of human population, yet every year, hundreds of millions [face hunger and undernourishment](https://www.who.int/news/item/28-07-2025-global-hunger-declines-but-rises-in-africa-and-western-asia-un-report){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

The world we inhabit is a paradox, our lives more so.
